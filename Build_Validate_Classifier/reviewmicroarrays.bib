	abstract = {{DNA} microarray technology is a key element in today's functional genomics toolbox. The power of the method lies in miniaturization, automation and parallelism permitting large-scale and genome-wide acquisition of quantitative biological information from multiple samples. {DNA} microarrays are currently fabricated and assayed by two main approaches involving either in situ synthesis of oligonucleotides ('oligonucleotide microarrays') or deposition of pre-synthesized {DNA} fragments ({'cDNA} microarrays') on solid surfaces. To date, the main applications of microarrays are in comprehensive, simultaneous gene expression monitoring and in {DNA} variation analyses for the identification and genotyping of mutations and polymorphisms. Already at a relatively early stage of its application in plant science, microarrays are being utilized to examine a range of biological issues including the circadian clock, plant defence, environmental stress responses, fruit ripening, phytochrome A signalling, seed development and nitrate assimilation. Novel insights are obtained into the molecular mechanisms co-ordinating metabolic pathways, regulatory and signalling networks. Exciting new information will be gained in the years to come not only from genome-wide expression analyses on a few model plant species, but also from extensive studies of less thoroughly studied species on a more limited scale. The value of microarray technology to our understanding of living processes will depend both on the amount of data to be generated and on its clever exploration and integration with other biological knowledge arising from complementary functional genomics tools for 'profiling' the genome, proteome, metabolome and phenome.},

	abstract = {Identification of new prognostic factors for colon cancer with no lymph node involvement may improve the selection of patients for adjuvant chemotherapy. The aim of this study was to assess the possibility of using gene expression profiling for this purpose. Fifty patients operated on for stage {II} colon cancer were included. Twenty-five of these patients relapsed, while the other 25 remained disease-free for at least 5 years. {MRNA} was extracted from fresh-frozen biopsies and hybridized to the Affymetrix {GeneChip} {HGU133A.} One thousand six hundred random splits of the 50 patients into a training set and a validation set were considered. For each split, a prognostic combination was derived from the training set (selection of the 30 genes most differentially expressed between patients who recurred and those who did not, by linear discriminant analysis), and its prognostic performance was assessed with the validation set. On average, accuracy was 76\%, sensitivity 85\%, and specificity 68\%. A total of 6,124 genes were included in at least one of the 1,600 predictive combinations, and 55 genes were included in more than 100 combinations. This study supports the possibility of predicting the prognosis of non-metastatic colon cancer by tumor gene expression profiling. It also shows the highly variable gene composition of predictive combinations.},

	abstract = {Proper analysis and mining of the rapidly growing amount of available genomic and proteomic data is vital for advances in biomedical research. Data Mining for Genomics and Proteomics describes efficient methods for analysis of gene and protein expression data. Dr. Darius Dziuda demonstrates step by step how biomedical studies can and should be performed to maximize the chance of extracting new and useful biomedical knowledge from available data. Readers receive clear guidance on when to use particular data mining methods and why, along with the reasons why some popular approaches can lead to inferior {results.This} book covers all aspects of gene and protein expression analysis---from technology, data preprocessing, quality assessment, and basic exploratory analysis to unsupervised and supervised learning algorithms, feature selection, and biomarker discovery. Also presented is a novel method for identification of the Informative Set of Genes, defined as a set containing all information significant for the differentiation of classes represented in training data. Special attention is given to multivariate biomarker discovery leading to parsimonious and generalizable classifiers. In addition, exercises and examples of hands-on analysis of real-world gene expression data sets give readers an opportunity to put the methods they have learned to practical {use.Data} Mining for Genomics and Proteomics is an excellent resource for data mining specialists, bioinformaricians, computational biologists, biomedical scientists, computer scientists, molecular biologists, and life scientists. It is also ideal for upper-level undergraduate and graduate-level students of bioinformatics, data mining, computational biology, and biomedical sciences, as well as anyone interested in efficient methods of knowledge discovery based on high-dimensional data.},

Until recently, diagnostic and prognostic assessment of diseased tissues and tumors relied heavily on indirect indicators that permitted only general classifications into broad histologic or morphologic subtypes and did not take into account the alterations in individual gene expression. Global expression analysis using microarrays now allows for simultaneous interrogation of the expression of thousands of genes in a high-throughput fashion and offers unprecedented opportunities to obtain molecular signatures of the state of activity of diseased cells and patient samples. Microarray analysis may provide invaluable information on disease pathology, progression, resistance to treatment, and response to cellular microenvironments and ultimately may lead to improved early diagnosis and innovative therapeutic approaches for cancer.},

	abstract = {{MOTIVATION:} Microarray data must be background corrected to remove the effects of non-specific binding or spatial heterogeneity across the array, but this practice typically causes other problems such as negative corrected intensities and high variability of low intensity log-ratios. Different estimators of background, and various model-based processing methods, are compared in this study in search of the best option for differential expression analyses of small microarray experiments. {RESULTS:} Using data where some independent truth in gene expression is known, eight different background correction alternatives are compared, in terms of precision and bias of the resulting gene expression measures, and in terms of their ability to detect differentially expressed genes as judged by two popular algorithms, {SAM} and limma {eBayes.} A new background processing method (normexp) is introduced which is based on a convolution model. The model-based correction methods are shown to be markedly superior to the usual practice of subtracting local background estimates. Methods which stabilize the variances of the log-ratios along the intensity range perform the best. The normexp+offset method is found to give the lowest false discovery rate overall, followed by morph and vsn. Like vsn, normexp is applicable to most types of two-colour microarray data. {AVAILABILITY:} The background correction methods compared in this article are available in the R package limma (Smyth, 2005) from http://www.bioconductor.org. {SUPPLEMENTARY} {INFORMATION:} Supplementary data are available from {http://bioinf.wehi.edu.au/resources/webReferences.html.}},

	abstract = {{MOTIVATION:} Spotted arrays are often printed with probes in duplicate or triplicate, but current methods for assessing differential expression are not able to make full use of the resulting information. The usual practice is to average the duplicate or triplicate results for each probe before assessing differential expression. This results in the loss of valuable information about genewise variability. {RESULTS:} A method is proposed for extracting more information from within-array replicate spots in microarray experiments by estimating the strength of the correlation between them. The method involves fitting separate linear models to the expression data for each gene but with a common value for the between-replicate correlation. The method greatly improves the precision with which the genewise variances are estimated and thereby improves inference methods designed to identify differentially expressed genes. The method may be combined with empirical Bayes methods for moderating the genewise variances between genes. The method is validated using data from a microarray experiment involving calibration and ratio control spots in conjunction with spiked-in {RNA.} Comparing results for calibration and ratio control spots shows that the common correlation method results in substantially better discrimination of differentially expressed genes from those which are not. The spike-in experiment also confirms that the results may be further improved by empirical Bayes smoothing of the variances when the sample size is small. {AVAILABILITY:} The methodology is implemented in the limma software package for R, available from the {CRAN} repository http://www.r-project.org},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

Concomitant with the rise in the popularity of {DNA} microarrays has been a surge of proposed methods for the analysis of microarray data. Fully controlled "spike-in" datasets are an invaluable but rare tool for assessing the performance of various methods.


{RESULTS}

We generated a new wholly defined Affymetrix spike-in dataset consisting of 18 microarrays. Over 5700 {RNAs} are spiked in at relative concentrations ranging from 1- to 4-fold, and the arrays from each condition are balanced with respect to both total {RNA} amount and degree of positive versus negative fold change. We use this new {"Platinum} Spike" dataset to evaluate microarray analysis routes and contrast the results to those achieved using our earlier Golden Spike dataset.


{CONCLUSIONS}

We present updated best-route methods for Affymetrix {GeneChip} analysis and demonstrate that the degree of "imbalance" in gene expression has a significant effect on the performance of these methods.},
