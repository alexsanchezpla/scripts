# Description

This folder contains a set of functions in a pre-packaged version and stored in the file "writeResults2Browser.R"

The main function of this file (and the only to be made visible in the package) is the function ```LinksFile2Html```
When this function is adequately invoked --as shown in file `writeResults2Browser_Example.R` it creates an HTML file with headers series of sections defined in the "links file".

The links file is an auxiliary file that may be automatically generated by certain pipelines or manually created if desired.
It must contain as many rows as desired under the (compulsory) headings:
-*FileName*  _Name of the file to be pointed at_
-*Category*	 _Main grouping in the page (see below)_
-*Subcategory*	_Subroup for each grouping. Actually set to «NA» until implemented_
-*Description*	_Textual description of what the file is about_
		
By default the names of the categories are:		
- "INFO", "DATA", "QC", "NORM", "ANALYSIS",ANNOT", "MULTCOMP", "CLUSTER", "GO", "KEGG", "IPA", "POWER")	
Which are automatically assigned the titles:		
- Reports and result summaries, Data and other input, Quality Control, Pre-processing, Analysis, Annotations, Multiple Comparisons, Cluster, GO Analysis, KEGG Analysis, Ingenuity Pathways Analysis, Power Analysis.

These categories names and descriptions can be overriden by providing new names and descriptions using the parameters		
- `categs.descs`	For the categories descriptions
-	`categs.names` 	For the categories names
The user is responsible to check that		
- Category Names provided in the file are also provided in the parameters «categs.names»	
- The length and order of 'categs.names' and 'categs.descs' is the same	

As an example saving the content of sheet «Template4LinksFile» as a tab separated text file		
and invoking function «LinksFile2Html» as described below or in file «write2Browser_Example.R» 		
will create the file «Resultats.html» that will provide access to files if available.

# Example

```{r eval=FALSE}
source ("writeResults2Browser.R") # To be replaced soon by 'library(writeResults2Browser.R")'

# Set values for input function

linksFileName <-"LinksFileName_Example.csv"
resultsDir <- "."
UEB <- TRUE # if UEB == TRUE => UEB header is used

htmlInfo <- list(To = "My Client", # nomClients,
                 Description = "Analysis of Biological Significance for some selected gene list",
                 Analysts = "Ferran Brianso and Alex Sanchez",               # analistes,
                 Contact = "Alex Sanchez (alex.sanchez@vhir.org)"
)

fCategs <- myGENCategs # General Categories Descriptions defined in the package. Type myGENcategs to see them
fNames <- myGENNames   # General Categories Names defined in the package. Type myGENcategs to see them

# Invoke main function 

LinksFile2Html(linksFileName,
               resultsDir,
               htmlInfo,
               categs.descs = fCategs,
               categs.names = fCategs,
               IndexDir = "",   # IndexDir : "ResultFiles/" (Paràmetre opcional)
               UEB = UEB,      
               resultsFileName="Resultats")

```
